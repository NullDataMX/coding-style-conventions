### Why Coding Conventions?

The main reason for using a consistent set of coding conventions is to standardize the structure and coding style of an application so that you and others can easily read and understand the code.

Good coding conventions result in precise, readable, and unambiguous source code that is consistent with other language conventions and as intuitive as possible.

### Minimal Coding Conventions

A general-purpose set of coding conventions should define the minimal requirements necessary to accomplish a given purpose, leaving the programmer free to create the programâ€™s logic and functional flow.

### How to use?

Good luck!
